# Prerequisites

## Install Visual Studio

Install Visual Studio 2017 from this the [official Microsoft downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Visual Studio is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is an advanced text editor which makes it easier to write code and run applications.

When you install Visual Studio you will also get the .Net Framework. This is the underlying technology that enables us to produce and run applications. There will be more on the .Net Framework later in guide, however you can find out more information from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/index).

## Dev Folder

When we begin coding we will need a _root_ folder to store our projects. While this can be any location on your file system it is recommended that you follow the guide here to make it easier to follow the instructions within the guide.

Using Widows Explorer or the command line create a folder called __dev__ directly on your __c__ drive e.g.

```
c/dev
```

::: warning
When working with code files it is best to avoid spaces within the path names to files i.e. avoid using folders and files with spaces in the names.

Spaces in paths seldomly cause issues but when they do it can be difficult identify them as the issue.

Having spaces in paths will make it more cumbersome to navigate to locations within the console or command line.
