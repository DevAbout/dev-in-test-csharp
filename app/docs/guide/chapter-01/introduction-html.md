# Introduction to HTML

In this chapter we will create our first web site. The purpose of this is to start learning about Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and other web technologies. This insight will be useful when writing UI based tests.

## Farm Recipes

We will be developing a site called __"Farm Recipes"__. This will be the first draft. We will implement just enough to help us understand the basics of HTML.

### Browser Display

We will begin by getting a basic file to show in the browser. Start by creating a folder under __dev__ called __farm-recipes__.

```shell
C:\dev\farm-recipes
```

Now open a simple text editor such as Notepad. Type this exact phrase:

```
Farm Recipes
```

Now we need to save this file __with the correct extension__ within __c\dev\farm-recipes__. In Notepad click `file > save as`. Browse to __C:\dev\farm-recipes__. In the file name enter __index.html__. Before saving, change __Save as type__ to __All Files (*.*). The last step is to click save.

::: tip
To verify that the file has the correct extension, open __c\dev\farm-recipes__ within Windows Explorer and double check the file extension. The file should end with __.html__ and not __.html.txt__.

::: tip
If the file extension is not visible [follow this How-To Geek article](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/).
:::

Windows Explorer should show __index.html__ with an icon of a browser. The extension enables Windows to assume that we typically want to open this file with a browser. Either double click this file, or right click and choose to open it in a browser of your choice.

::: tip
Google Chrome has excellent tools for examining HTML documents.
